Goal of Assignment 1: To create and manage a git repo with Github. 

Goal of Assignment 2: To correctly and efficiently set up environment using an environmental variable and an alias. To practice use git commands. 

Process: 
1) I created a directory called PUI2017 using mkdir 
2) I created an environmental variable using 'export'. This tells the machine that PUI2017 means the given file path.
3) I created an alias using 'alias'.  This tells the machine when I type 'pui2017' to change directory to the path specified in the environmental variable.
