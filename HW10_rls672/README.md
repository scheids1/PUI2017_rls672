I worked with people to understand the structure of the data and to compare results. Dana provided some code for task 2 around the AD Fuller test. 

Collaborated with: Emily, Dana, Matt, Julian 

I also utilized Prof Biancoâ€™s notebooks from Lab 10 https://github.com/fedhere/UInotebooks/tree/master/timeseries (particularly for task 3)
