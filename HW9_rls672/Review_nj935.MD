**CLARITY**: *****is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*****

The font and text size of the titles and labels are easy to read. The plot has a title and caption. The quantities are percentages with one decimal point, which is easy to understand. 

One confusing aspect is that the types of cuisine included change per season. For instance, the Winter plot has "Hamburgers", 
which none of the other plots have. 

Additionally, it is not clear exactly what the percent is. I imagine there are more cuisine types, so this cannot be the percent of total violations. Is it 100% divided by the top 8 cuisine types for that particular season? 


**ESTHETIC**: *****beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is 
"beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors 
chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? 
Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*****

The colors as they correspond to cuisine type changes throghout the four plots. For example, in the Spring plot, 
"American" is orange, but in the other three plots, it is blue. On a similar note, gray is a different cuisine type in every plot. If people are not reading the labels, they might assume that gray is the same cuisne type and draw incorrect conclusions. 

When checking for colorblind standards, it becomes challenging or impossible to differentiate many of the colors. Because the labels are there, you could still convey the point, but it makes it less clear.. 

Each pie chart is easy to read on its own, but when plotted together, it is overwhelming and difficult to compare across all 
four. I think a bar plot might be a better option, which I think would make it easier to compare both season and cuisine type.


**HONESTY**: *****is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*****

Without being overly familiar with the underlaying data, the plot does not seem to be manipulating the data. 

However, I would be curious to know how often inspections are done. For instance, perhaps it just so happens that signficantly more American restaurants are inspected during summer, and thus account for more of the violations. Domain knowledge would be useful here. 

Additionally, I would imagine there are just more American restaurants in general, so it isn't surprising that they account for a higher percentage of violations. A more interesting question might be what percent of of each cuisine type has violations (ie 250 out of 1000 American restaurants had violations (25%) versus 75 out out 100 pizza restaurants (75%)). 

**IMPROVEMENTS TO EACH PLOT**

All the mentioned critiques are areas of improvement. Ultimately, I think a different visualization type other than pie charts would be better. If sticking with the pie charts, I think the most important 2 improvements are: 

- Make colors colorblind friendly 
- Clarify what the quantity being plotted is
- Keep the cuisine types consistent or use different colors for them all 

Overall, I think this data could be better conveyed in a singular plot, rather than 4 plots. 



**Review of Extra Plot** 

Quick review: It is useful seeing the absolute terms of violations to get a better idea of what the data means. It is still challenging to compare across seasons and cuisine types. 

Main Suggestions for Improvement: 
- Y axis needs label
- If trying to compare across seasons, keep the ylim the same (350 seems appropriate)
