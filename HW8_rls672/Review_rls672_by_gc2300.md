The review first assesses the clarity of the plot, then analyzes the esthetic and honesty, finally a overall opinion will be given.
#
### Clarity:
The plot is a bar chart describing the number of trees by NYC borough in the year of 1995, 2005 and 2015. For the five boroughs, the trends of the number of trees are clear to see. However, the numbers in y axis denoting the number of trees are up to hundred thousands digit, which makes it a little bit hard to read. It could be better if the number of trees are in per thousand. Besides, there is enough space for x axis' label, so the rotation of the names of borough is not neccessary and brings difficulty to read.
#
### Esthtic:
A bar chart was chosen to visualize the variation in the number of trees in year of 1995, 2005 and 2015, which is not appropriate. Bart chart is suitable for categorical data with no natural ordering of the categories. For each borough, there are data for three years, which are not three categories. It's better to use a scatter plot with time as the x axis with boroughs in different colors and the points of each borough being linked with a line to show the trend. The colors are properly chosen. The lines in the background help readers comparing the quantities. The graphical elements are properly used and there is nothing distracting.
#
### Honesty:
The proportionality of the plot's graphic elements is consistent, which guarantees the honesty of the plot.
#     

The conclusion generated from the plot, all boroughs have continuously seen an increase in the number of trees since 1995, is not convincing. There are only three years' data. This can be improved by involving every year's data since 1995. Overall, it is a good plot but can be improved. Well done!
